# NC Binutils
A bunch of bin utilities(duh) that I created for fun or out of necessity

# Utils
**[Bindump](https://github.com/voidwyrm-2/bindump)**<br>
Prints the byte contents of a file

**[Bingen](https://github.com/voidwyrm-2/bingen)**<br>
Generates a binary file from a very simple file format

**[TagMake](https://github.com/voidwyrm-2/tagmake)**<br>
A very, very, niche CMake-inspired console app I made in 15 minutes to make creating minecraft tags the slightest bit easier
